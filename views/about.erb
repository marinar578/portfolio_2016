    <h2>I'm Marina! I'm a programmer, a former editor, an avid learner, and I'm based in NYC. </h2>
    <p>Currently, I work at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/marina-rozova/8514" target="blank"> General Assembly</a> as an Instructional Associate for their March - June 2016 instance of the Web Development Immersive Bootcamp. I've been coding on my own for the last year and a half, and have added to my education by taking part-time and full-time web development courses. From November 2015 to March 2016, I attended General Assembly's immersive bootcamp myself, and gained more experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, Rails, React, node.js, PostgreSQL, and other languages and technologies.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about creating beautiful, efficient applications. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/marinar578" target="blank">code</a> and my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rozovamarina" target="blank">linkedin</a> for more info on the work I've done.</p>
